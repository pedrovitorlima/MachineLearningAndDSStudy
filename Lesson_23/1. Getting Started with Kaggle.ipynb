    "[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) is a site where people create algorithms and compete against machine learning practitioners around the world. Your algorithm wins the competition if it's the most accurate on a particular data set. Kaggle is a fun way to practice your machine learning skills.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this mission and the ones that follow, we're going to learn how to compete in Kaggle competitions. In this introductory mission we'll learn how to:\n",

    "- Explore the competition data and learn about the competition topic\n",
    "- Prepare data for machine learning\n",

    "Kaggle has created a number of competitions designed for beginners. The most popular of these competitions, and the one we'll be looking at, is about predicting which [passengers survived the sinking of the Titanic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinking_of_the_RMS_Titanic).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this competition, we have a data set of different information about passengers onboard the Titanic, and we see if we can use that information to predict whether those people survived or not. Before we start looking at this specific competition, let's take a moment to understand how Kaggle competitions work.\n",
