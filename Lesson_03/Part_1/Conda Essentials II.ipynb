    "# Working with environments\n",
    "\n",
    "Conda **environments** allow multiple incompatible versions of the same (software) package to coexist on your system. An **environment** is simply a filepath containing a collection of mutually compatible packages. By isolating distinct versions of a given package (and their dependencies) in distinct **environments**, those versions are all available to work on particular projects or tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a large number of reasons why it is best practice to use **environments**, whether as a data scientist, software developer, or domain specialist. Without the concept of **environments**, users essentially rely on and are restricted to whichever particular package versions are installed globally (or in their own user accounts) on a particular machine. Even when one user moves scripts between machines (or shares them with a colleague), the configuration is often inconsistent in ways that interfere with seamless functionality. Conda **environments** solve both these problems. You can easily maintain and switch between as many **environments** as you like, and each one has exactly the collection of packages that you want.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you may develop a project comprising scripts, notebooks, libraries, or other resources that depend on a particular collection of package versions. You later want to be able to switch flexibly to newer versions of those packages and to ensure the project continues to function properly before switching wholly. Or likewise, you may want to share code with colleagues who are required to use certain package versions. In this context, an **environment** is a way of documenting a known set of packages that correctly support your project.\n",

    "# Which environment am I using?\n",
    "\n",
    "When using **conda**, you are always in some environment, but it may be the default (called the **base** or **root** environment). Your current environment has a name and contains a collection of packages currently associated with that environment. There are a few ways to determine the current environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most obviously, at a terminal prompt, the name of the current environment is usually prepended to the rest of your prompt in parentheses. Alternatively, the subcommand **conda env list** displays a list of all environments on your current system; the currently activated one is marked with an asterisk in the middle column. The subcommands of **conda env** (sometimes with suitable switches) encompass most of your needs for working with environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of **conda env list** shows that each environment is associated with a particular directory. This is **not** the same as your current working directory for a given project; being \"in\" an environment is completely independent of the directory you are working in. Indeed, you often wish to preserve a certain Conda environment and edit resources across multiple project directories (all of which rely on the same environment). The environment directory displayed by **conda env list** is simply the top-level filepath in which all resources associated with that environment are stored; you need never manipulate those environment directories directly (other than via the **conda** command); indeed, it is much safer to leave those directories alone!\n",

    "Clearly this version is much less specific than what **conda env export** produces. But it indicates the general tools, with some version specification, that will be required to work on a shared project. Actually creating an environment from this sketched out specification will fill in all the dependencies of those large projects whose packages are named, and this will install dozens of packages not explicitly listed. Often you are happy to have other dependencies in the manner **conda** decides is best.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, a fully fleshed out specification like we saw in the previous exercise are equally usable. Non-relevant details like the path to the environment on the local system are ignored when installing to a different machine—or indeed to a different platform altogether, which will work equally well.\n",

    "To create an environment from **file-name.yml**, you can use the following command:\n",
