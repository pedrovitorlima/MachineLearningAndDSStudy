The values 0 and 1 don't have any numerical weight and are instead act as numerical placeholders for the two categories. We can instead try to learn the probability that a given observation belongs in either category.\n",

While we won't provide the depth here needed to learn trigonometry from scratch, we do recommend the [Trigonometry Series on Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/trigonometry) if you're new to trigonometry.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is trigonometry?\n",
    "\n",
    "Trigonometry is short for triangle geometry and provides formulas, frameworks, and mental models for reasoning about triangles. Triangles are used extensively in theoretical and applied mathematics, and build on mathematical work done over many centuries. Let's start by clearly defining what a triangle is.\n",

    "A triangle is a [polygon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygon) that has the following properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 3 edges\n",
    "- 3 vertices\n",
    "- angles between edges add up to 180 degrees\n",

    "An important triangle that's classified by the internal angles is the **right angle triangle**. In a right angle triangle, one of the angles is 90 degrees (also known as the right angle). The edge opposite of the right angle is called the hypotenuse.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "A trigonometric function is a function that inputs an angle value (usually represented as $\\theta$) and outputs some value. These functions compute ratios between the edge lengths. Here are the first 3 trigonometric functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "sin(\\theta) = \\frac{opposite}{hypotenuse}\\\\\n",

    "- Hypotenuse describes the line that isn't touching the right angle.\n",
    "- Opposite refers to the line opposite the angle.\n",

    "Now, how does all of this relate to Cartesian coordinate system? The key idea that lets us plot trigonometric functions on a traditional Cartesian coordinate system is the important relationship between right angle triangles and the **unit circle**. The unit circle is a specific type of circle where the radius is 1 (and usually centered at  (0,0). In a unit circle, any line from the center to the circle itself (in red below) forms a right angle triangle.\n",

After we train a decision tree model, we can visualize the tree, interpret it, and have new ideas for tweaking the model. Neural networks, on the other hand, are much closer to being a **black box**. In a black box model, we can understand the inputs and the outputs but the intermediate features are actually difficult to interpret and understand. Even harder and perhaps more importantly, it's difficult to understand how to tweak a neural network based on these intermediate features.\n",

    "In the last section, we learned how adding hidden layers of neurons to a neural network can improve its ability to capture nonlinearity in the data. We tested different neural networks models on a dataset that we generated with deliberate nonlinearity.\n",

    "\n",
    "- explore why image classification is a hard task\n",
    "- observe the limitations of traditional machine learning models for image classification\n",
    "- train, test, and improve a few different deep neural networks for image classification\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As we mentioned in the first section in this lesson, deep neural networks have been used to reach state-of-the-art performance on **image classification** tasks in the last decade. For some image classification tasks, deep neural networks actually perform as well as or slightly better than the human benchmark. You can read about the history of deep neural networks [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.01164.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "To end this lesson, we'll build models that can classify handwritten digits. Before the year 2000, institutions like the United States Post Office used handwriting recognition software to read addresses, zip codes, and more. One of their approaches, which consists of pre-processing handwritten images then feeding to a neural network model is detailed in this [paper](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.852.5499&rep=rep1&type=pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is image classifcation a hard task?\n",
    "\n",
    "Within the field of machine learning and pattern recognition, image classification (especially for handwritten text) is towards the difficult end of the spectrum. There are a few reasons for this.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, each image in a training set is high dimensional. Each pixel in an image is a feature and a separate column. This means that a 128 x 128 image has 16384 features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, images are often downsampled to lower resolutions and transformed to grayscale (no color). This is a limitation of compute power unfortunately. The resolution of a 8 megapixel photo has 3264 by 2448 pixels, for a total of 7,990,272 features (or about 8 million). Images of this resolution are usually scaled down to between 128 and 512 pixels in either direction for significantly faster processing. This often results in a loss of detail that's available for training and pattern matching.\n",
    "\n",
    "Third, the features in an image don't have an obvious linear or nonlinear relationship that can be learned with a model like linear or logistic regression. In grayscale, each pixel is just represented as a brightness value ranging from 0 to 256.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of how an image is represented across the different abstractions we care about:\n",
    "\n",
    "<left><img width=\"600\" alt=\"creating a repo\" src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1TEFvHIvnBTJevVGDhMlRvu-0_0jSxfVb\"></left>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is deep learning effective in image classification?\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep learning is effective in image classification because of the models' **ability to learn hierarchical representations**. At a high level, an effective deep learning model learns intermediate representations at each layer in the model and uses them in the prediction process. Here's a diagram that visualizes what the weights represent at each layer of a **convolutional neural network**, a type of network that's often used in image classification and unfortunately out of scope for this lesson, which was trained to identify faces.\n",
    "\n",
    "<left><img width=\"600\" alt=\"creating a repo\" src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1Rd4p4C9Xg75FZ9IPaTWQq56sIhGEQpm-\"></left>\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll notice in the first hidden layer the network learned to represent edges and specific features of faces. In the second hidden layer, the weights seemed to represent higher level facial features like eyes and noses. Finally, the weights in the last hidden layer resemble faces that could be matched against. Each successive layer uses weights from previous layers to try to learn more complex representations.\n"

To visualize the image, we need to reshape these pixel values back into the 28 by 28 and plot them on a coordinate grid.\n",
