    "Comparing the **five distributions** is now easier, and we can make a couple of observations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- There's only one **rookie** playing on a combined position **(F/C)**. This is significantly less compared to more experienced players, which suggests that combined positions (**F/C** and **G/F**) may require more complex skills on the field that rookies rarely have.\n",
    "- Rookies are the only category where we don't find players on all positions. We can see there are no rookies who play on a G/F position.\n",
    "- Guards predominate for every level of experience. This probably means that most players in a basketball team are guards. It's worth examining the distributions of a couple of teams to find whether this is true. If it's true, it might be interesting to find out why teams need so many guards.\n",
