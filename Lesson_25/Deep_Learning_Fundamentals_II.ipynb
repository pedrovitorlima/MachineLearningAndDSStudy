        "\n",
        "A concise definition of the field would be as follows: **the effort to automate intellectual tasks normally performed by humans**. As such, AI is a general field that encompasses machine learning and deep learning, but that also includes many more approaches that don’t involve any learning. Early chess programs, for instance, only involved hardcoded rules crafted by programmers, and didn’t qualify as machine learning. For a fairly long time, many experts believed that human-level artificial intelligence could be achieved by having programmers handcraft a sufficiently large set of explicit rules for manipulating knowledge. This approach is known as **symbolic AI**, and it was the dominant paradigm in AI from the 1950s to the late 1980s. It reached its peak popularity during the **expert systems boom** of the 1980s.\n",
        "\n",
        "Although symbolic AI proved suitable to solve well-defined, logical problems, such as playing chess, it turned out to be intractable to figure out explicit rules for solving more complex, fuzzy problems, such as image classification, speech recognition, and language translation. A new approach arose to take symbolic AI’s place: **machine learning**.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1.1.2 Machine Learning\n",
        "\n",
        "Machine learning arises from this question: **could a computer go beyond** “what we know how to order it to perform” and learn on its own how to perform a specified task? **Could a computer surprise us**? Rather than programmers crafting data-processing rules by hand, **could a computer automatically learn these rules by looking at data**?\n",
        "\n",
        "This question opens the door to a new programming paradigm. In classical programming, the paradigm of symbolic AI, humans input rules (a program) and data to be processed according to these rules, and out come answers (see figure 1.2). With machine learning, humans input data as well as the answers expected from the data, and out come the rules. These rules can then be applied to new data to produce original answers.\n",

        "Although machine learning only started to flourish in the 1990s, it has quickly become the most popular and most successful subfield of AI, **a trend driven by the availability of faster hardware and larger datasets**. Machine learning is tightly related to mathematical statistics, but it differs from statistics in several important ways. Unlike statistics, machine learning tends to deal with large, complex datasets (such as a dataset of millions of images, each consisting of tens of thousands of pixels) for which classical statistical analysis such as Bayesian analysis would be impractical. As a result, machine learning, and especially deep learning, exhibits comparatively little mathematical theory—maybe too little—and is engineering oriented. It’s a hands-on discipline in which ideas are proven empirically more often than theoretically.\n",
        "\n",
        "So that’s what machine learning is, technically: **searching for useful representations of some input data, within a predefined space of possibilities, using guidance from a feedback signal**. This simple idea allows for solving a remarkably broad range of intellectual tasks, from speech recognition to autonomous car driving.\n",

        "Initially, the weights of the network are assigned random values, so the network merely implements a series of random transformations. Naturally, its output is far from what it should ideally be, and the loss score is accordingly very high. But with every example the network processes, the weights are adjusted a little in the correct direction, and the loss score decreases. This is the training loop, which, repeated a sufficient number of times (typically tens of iterations over thousands of examples), yields weight values that minimize the loss function. **A network with a minimal loss is one for which the outputs are as close as they can be to the targets: a trained network.**"

        "### 1.2.1 Probabilistic modeling\n",
        "\n",
        "Probabilistic modeling is the **application of the principles of statistics** to data analysis. It was one of the earliest forms of machine learning, and it’s still widely used to this day. One of the best-known algorithms in this category is the **Naive Bayes algorithm**.\n",
        "\n",
        "A closely related model is the **logistic regression** (logreg for short), which is sometimes considered to be the **“hello world” of modern machine learning**. Don’t be misled by its name—logreg is a classification algorithm rather than a regression algorithm. \n",
        "\n",
        "Much like **Naive Bayes**, **logreg** predates computing by a long time, yet it’s still useful to this day, thanks to its simple and versatile nature. It’s often the first thing a data scientist will try on a dataset to get a feel for the classification task at hand.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1.2.2. Early neural networks\n",
        "Although the core ideas of neural networks were investigated in toy forms as early as the **1950s**, the approach took decades to get started. For a long time, **the missing piece was an efficient way to train large neural networks**. \n",
        "\n",
        "This changed in the **mid-1980s**, when multiple people independently rediscovered the **Backpropagation algorithm** -- a way to train chains of parametric operations using gradient-descent optimization -- and started applying it to neural networks.\n",
        "\n",
        "**The first successful practical application of neural nets came in 1989 from Bell Labs**, when [Yann LeCun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yann_LeCun) combined the earlier ideas of convolutional neural networks and backpropagation, and applied them to the problem of classifying handwritten digits. The resulting network, dubbed LeNet, was used by the United States Postal Service in the 1990s to automate the reading of ZIP codes on mail envelopes.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1.2.3. Kernel methods\n",
        "\n",
        "As neural networks started to gain some respect among researchers in the 1990s, thanks to this first success, a new approach to machine learning rose to fame and quickly sent neural nets back to oblivion: **kernel methods**. Kernel methods are a **group of classification algorithms**, the best known of which is the **support vector machine (SVM)**. The modern formulation of an SVM was developed by Vladimir Vapnik and Corinna Cortes in the early **1990s** at Bell Labs and published in **1995**, although an older linear formulation was published by Vapnik and Alexey Chervonenkis as early as **1963**.\n",

Because of these useful properties, **SVMs became extremely popular in the field for a long time**.\n",
        "\n",
        "**But SVMs proved hard to scale to large datasets and didn’t provide good results for perceptual problems such as image classification**. Because an SVM is a shallow method, applying an SVM to perceptual problems requires first extracting useful representations manually (a step called **feature engineering**), which is difficult and brittle.\n",

        "**A gradient boosting machine**, much like a random forest, is a machine-learning technique based on **ensembling weak prediction models**, generally decision trees. It uses gradient boosting, a way to improve any machine-learning model by iteratively training new models that specialize in addressing the weak points of the previous models. Applied to decision trees, the use of the gradient boosting technique results in models that **strictly outperform random forests most of the time, while having similar properties**. **It may be one of the best, if not the best, algorithm for dealing with nonperceptual data today**.
