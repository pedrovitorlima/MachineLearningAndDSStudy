If all the labels are different, they'll have high entropy. Splits that give us more information about the data, will ideally minimize entropy. In other words, the tree will ideally split the labels into distinct groups with as little mixture possible. This'll allow the splits to give our tree more predictive power.\n",

This is because while one tree can construct an incorrect and overfit model, the average of 100 or more trees will be more likely to hone in on the signal and ignore the noise.

    "As we can see in the code cell from the previous section, overfitting decreased with a Random Forest, and accuracy went up overall.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the random forest algorithm is incredibly powerful, it isn't applicable to all tasks. The main **strengths** of a **Random Forest** are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Very accurate predictions** - Random forests achieve near state-of-the-art performance on many machine learning tasks. Along with neural networks and gradient-boosted trees, they're typically one of the top-performing algorithms.\n",
    "- **Resistance to overfitting** - Due to their construction, Random Forests are fairly resistant to overfitting. We still need to set and tweak parameters like **max_depth** though.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main **weaknesses** of using a **Random Forest** are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **They're difficult to interpret** - Because we've averaging the results of many trees, it can be hard to figure out why a Random Forest is making predictions the way it is.\n",
    "- **They take longer to create** - Making two trees takes twice as long as making one, making three takes three times as long, and so on. Fortunately, we can exploit multicore processors to parallelize tree construction. Scikit allows us to do this through the **n_jobs** parameter on [RandomForestClassifier](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier.html). We'll discuss parallelization in greater detail later on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given these trade-offs, it makes sense to use Random Forests in situations where accuracy is of the utmost importance; being able to interpret or explain the decisions the model is making isn't key. In cases where time is of the essence or interpretability is important, a single decision tree may be a better choice."
