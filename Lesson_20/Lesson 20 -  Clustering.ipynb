    "We'll use an algorithm called [k-means clustering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering) to split our data into clusters. k-means clustering uses Euclidean distance to form clusters of similar Senators. We'll dive more into the theory of k-means clustering and build the algorithm from the ground up in the later section. For now, it's important to understand clustering at a high level, so we'll leverage the [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) library to train a **k-means model.**\n",

    "One great way to explore clusters is to visualize them using **matplotlib**. Earlier, we computed a **senator_distances** array that shows the distance from each Senator to the center of each cluster. We can treat these distances as x and y coordinates, and make a scatterplot that shows the position of each Senator. This works because the distances are relative to the cluster centers.\n",

We are going to focus our lesson on a machine learning technique called **clustering**, which allows us to visualize the types of point guards as well as group similar point guards together. **Using 2 features** allows us to easily visualize the players and will also make it easier to grasp how clustering works. For point guards, it's widely accepted that the **Assist to Turnover Ratio** is a good indicator for performance in games as it quantifies the number of scoring opportunities that player created.
