    "You might not have been very impressed by what we've just got with sampling proportionally. The variability of the sampling was quite large, and many sample means were unrepresentative, being far from the population mean. In fact, this sampling method doesn't seem to perform better than simple random sampling:\n",

    "<center><img width=\"600\" src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1uoEz0OppoAB-I7-IK9r4A4SfQizf4UHZ\"></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "The poor performance is caused by a bad choice of strata. We stratified the data by the number of games played, but this isn't a good approach. A player is considered as having played one game even if she only played for one or two minutes. But others play 30 or 40 minutes, and they're still considered as having played one game.\n",
    "\n",
    "It makes more sense to stratify the data by number of minutes played, rather than by number of games played. The minutes played are a much better indicator of how much a player scored in a season than the number of games played.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our data set contains the total amount of minutes a player had for the entire season. If we make strata based on minutes played, and then sample proportionally using stratified sampling, we get something visibly better than simple random sampling (especially in terms of variability):\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img width=\"800\" src=\"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1dBdLH2qGGGdu4mph-2GzCVfuBoizO_Tq\"></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We increased the sample size to 12 so that we can do a better proportional sampling for the strata organized by minutes played.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few guidelines for choosing good strata:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Minimize the variability within each stratum.**\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, avoid having in the same stratum a player that has scored 10 points and a player that has scored 500. If the variability is high, it might be a sign that you either need a more granular stratification (need more strata), or you need to change the criterion of stratification (an example of criterion is minutes played).\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Maximize the variability between strata.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Good strata are different from one another. If you have strata that are similar to one another with respect to what you want to measure, you might need a more granular stratification, or to change the stratification criterion. In the previous screen, stratifying the data by games played resulted in strata that weren't too different from each other with respect to the distribution of the total points. We managed to increase the variability between strata by changing the criterion of stratification to minutes played.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. The stratification criterion should be strongly correlated with the property you're trying to measure.**\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, the column describing minutes played (the criterion) should be strongly correlated with the number of total points (property we want to measure). We've covered briefly the concept of correlation in the pandas lessons, and we'll cover it again later in these statistics lessons, so don't worry if the concept of correlation doesn't make much sense to you now.\n",
    "\n",
    "We've left the code editor open for you to try to experiment with the different sampling methods we've learned so far. One thing you can try is to replicate the last graph above. You can then play with sample sizes, and try to get insights into how variability and sampling error change."

The website centralizes data on basketball games and players in WNBA. Let's suppose for a moment that there weren't such a site, and the data would be scattered instead across each individual team's website. There are twelve unique teams in our data set, which means we'd have to scrape twelve different websites, each requiring its own scraping script.\n",

    "This scenario is quite common in the data science workflow: you want to answer some questions about a population, but the data is scattered in such a way that data collection is either time-consuming, either close to impossible. For instance, let's say you want to analyze how people review and rate movies as a function of movie budget. There are a lot of websites out there that can help with data collection, but how can you go about so that you can spend one day or two on getting the data you need, rather than one month or two?\n",

The marketing team asks you to analyze the data and find categories of customers with a low buying rate, so that they can target their marketing campaigns at the right people. Instead of working with more than 10 million rows at each step of your analysis, you can save a lot of code running time by sampling several hundred rows, and perform your analysis on the sample. You can do a simple random sampling, but if you're interested in some categories beforehand, it might be a good idea to use stratified sampling.\n",

    "Do all these players really have the exact same weight? Most likely, they don't. If the values were measured with a precision of one decimal, we'd probably see that the players have different weights. One player may weigh 76.7 kg, another 77.2 kg, another 77.1 kg.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an important parenthesis here, the weight values in the table above are all 77.0, and the trailing zero suggests a precision of one decimal point, but this is not the case. The values are automatically converted by **pandas** to **float64** because of one **NaN** value in the **Weight** column, and end up with a trailing zero, which gives the false impression of one decimal point precision. So a player was recorded to weigh 77 kg (zero decimals precision), not 77.0 kg (one decimal precision).\n",
    "\n",
    "Returning to our discussion, if we measure the weight with zero decimals precision (which we do in our data set), a player weighing 77.4 kg will be assigned the same weight (77 kg) as a player weighing 76.6 kg. So if a player is recorded to weigh 77 kg, we can only tell that her actual weight is somewhere between 76.5 kg and 77.5 kg. The value of 77 is not really a distinct value here. Rather, it's an **interval** of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "This principle applies to any possible numerical weight value. If a player is measured to weigh 76.5 kg, we can only tell that her weight is somewhere between 76.45 kg and 76.55 kg. If a player has 76.50 kg, we can only tell that her weight is somewhere between 76.495 kg and 76.505 kg. Because there can be an infinite number of decimals, we could continue this breakdown infinitely.\n",

    "Generally, every value of a continuous variable is an interval, no matter how precise the value is. The boundaries of an interval are sometimes called **real limits**. The lower boundary of the interval is called **lower real limit**, and the upper boundary is called **upper real limit.**\n",

    "In the figure above we can see for example that 88.5 is halfway between 88 and 89. If we got a measurement of 88.5 kg in practice, but we want only integers in our dataset (hence zero decimals precision), you might wonder whether to assign the value to 88 or 89 kg. The answer is that 88.5 kg is exactly halfway between 88 and 89 kg, and it doesn't necessarily belong to any of those two values. The assignment only depends on how you choose to round numbers: if you round up, then 88.5 kg will be assigned to 89 kg; if you round down, then the value will be assigned to 88 kg.\n",
